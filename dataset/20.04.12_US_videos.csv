This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic. The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades. These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.But what is really going on here?Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?I don‚Äôt burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?what does this mean for the future of international trade?And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?Enjoyed the video?

The key to getting rid of fat around the waist is to realize that it too, just like all body fat, is something that can be done with persistence and a few important strategies. While there is no such thing as love handle exercises or exercises to burn lower belly fat, there are things you can do in and out of the gym to see results much faster.The first thing you have to do to get rid of fat around the waist or love handles is take a close look at how you‚Äôre eating. Nutrition is and always will be the number one priority when it comes to getting ripped and losing body fat. All too often, people want to skip this part of the equation because it is the one that is most difficult to stay consistent with, but it‚Äôs where all the difference matters.Many people will turn to different kinds of diets in order to lose fat fast. The problem with most diets is that they are temporary solutions to a long term problem. And even when you follow the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the diet plan, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you are going to lose fat. For instance, if your keto plan has you avoiding carbs but you still wind up overeating significantly on fats and proteins and are unable to get to a hypo caloric state, you are not going to lose your love handles.Similarly, if you are following a diet strategy like intermittent fasting as a way of losing the fat around the waistline, be advised that simply eating within the proper window does not guarantee success. Again, if you consume more calories than you are burning off you are not going to burn enough fat to get rid of that around your belly.The second big nutrition mistake relates to the first and that is, even if you can do everything right with your nutrition but you quit too soon you likely will not see the results you‚Äôre looking for. Keep in mind that in men especially, waistline and lower belly fat is the last to go. This pertains to the low back as well. You will first start to see fat loss in the face and neck but only when you‚Äôve been consistent for a long period of time will you see the love handles start to disappear. Don‚Äôt give up too soon just because you don‚Äôt see the fat loss in the love handles. Realize that it‚Äôs coming, it just will take a bit more time.As far as training goes, there are some things you can do to get rid of love handles faster. You need to be sure that as the fat loss occurs that the muscles underneath are developed and looking good which will give the appearance of a better looking waistline sooner. Here is where you want to be sure you‚Äôre not just doing traditional ab exercises.Train your obliques. People often say that doing oblique exercises will thicken your waistline. This isn‚Äôt the significant cause of why you have a thick waist, it‚Äôs the body fat laying over the top. So that said, be sure to include a healthy dose of rotational oblique exercises and even add in weighted exercises to be sure that you‚Äôre building the muscle and training it hard enough to make a difference in its appearance.Here is where you want to be sure that you‚Äôre doing your ab exercises right. The bicycle crunch and russian twists are two moves that many people screw up when trying to train for a trim waistline. Don‚Äôt just flip your hands and elbows across your body but be sure to rotate as you do. Lock your hands or elbows in place and rotate your entire torso as you move to really etch in those deep oblique muscles. Finally, don‚Äôt forget the broom stick twist. This classic oblique exercise is great for giving you high quality contractions of the obliques to make them pop out as you lose the love handle fat laying over the top of them.If you‚Äôre looking for a step by step workout program that includes a meal plan to help you lose fat fast, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and use the program selector to find the workout plan best suited to your goals.
