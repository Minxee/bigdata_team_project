Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!See you in class!-Mark"

In War On Drugs, we examine the social implications of prohibition worldwide. Any attempt to shut down the trade in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine or weed invariably sets off a chain of events that just makes things worse, leaving a trail of death, illness, violence, slavery, addiction, crime and inequality across the globe. Everyone loses – except, in a weird kind of way, the drugs themselves.

Eddie Van Halen had battled all kinds of cancer for years, and it was originally reported that the guitar god succumbed to lung cancer. Van Halen was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2000, following years of cigarettes and booze ... and guitar picks? He would later say he believed the cancer was caused by the metal in the pick he often held in his mouth. Either way, he had part of his tongue removed in 2002, and he said it was the part that his copper and brass guitar picks always touched.He was regularly treated for the cancer through the years, but it eventually began to spread even further through his body, including to his lungs. When he died, it was announced that he had lost his battle with cancer. However, according to his death certificate obtained by TMZ, while Eddie definitely did suffer from several debilitating medical conditions — including lung and skin cancers, pneumonia, and a disorder affecting the bone marrow called myelodysplastic syndrome — the official cause of death was a stroke.TMZ also reported Eddie's wishes about what should be done with his remains. His body was cremated 22 days after his death, and the ashes were received by his son, Wolfgang. The Eruption soloist's final wishes stated that his ashes be scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Malibu. Eddie and Wolfgang were very close both on and off stage, so you can bet that Wolfgang will honor his father's final wishes. Wolfgang tweeted the day his father died,He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift. [...] I love you so much, Pop.Released on November 16, the first single on Wolfgang's pending first solo album was a tribute to his late father. According to Guitar World, Wolfgang dedicated the song Distance to Eddie, saying it was one of his father's favorites on the album. Wolfgang said, 'Distance' is a song that was initially written for the debut album, but was going to be held for a later time. [...] As my pop continued to struggle with various health issues, I was imagining what my life would be like without him and how terribly I'd miss him. While this song is incredibly personal, I think anyone can relate to the idea of having a profound loss in their own life. He said he hadn't planned on the song being the first solo tune of his that the public would hear, but he decided to release it in honor of his father's legacy. Saying, This is for him.Eddie said before he passed that the album sounded like, AC/DC meets Van Halen meets aggressive pop. The riffs are catchy. It's a little of everything and sounds like a freight train coming at you. I've never heard anything quite like it. It's so powerful that I'm jealous. Considering the source of the praise, that's quite the compliment. Now the world waits and listens for what else comes from the next generation of the Van Halen legacy.#EddieVanHalen #VanHalenRead Full Article: https://www.grunge.com/295473/eddie-van-halens-cause-of-death-officially-confirmed/"

Este especial se lanza en tres partes, la primera estará disponible este viernes, 4 de diciembre, mientras que la segunda y tercera parte estarán disponibles el 12 y 19 de diciembre, respectivamente. “Este año ha sido difícil para todos nosotros y qué mejor forma de comenzar la temporada navideña, sino es recordando y celebrando el aniversario de uno de mis mayores logros como artista y espero que los llene a todos de mucha alegría”, expresó Daddy Yankee. En diciembre 2019, “Con Calma Pal’ Choli” se convirtió en la única serie de conciertos en romper récords por ser la más taquillera jamás realizada en Puerto Rico, con más de 170,000 boletos vendidos en un mes. Producido por el promotor de conciertos puertorriqueño Rafael Pina, el espectáculo brindó una experiencia única a todos sus fanáticos en Puerto Rico utilizando la más alta tecnología y llevándolos a través de un viaje musical interpretando los mayores éxitos de sus casi 30 años de carrera. Yankee también contó con la participación de invitados especiales durante cada uno de los espectáculos, incluyendo a artistas tales como Luis Fonsi, Wisin & Yandel y Nicky Jam, entre otros.Se alentará a los espectadores [o fanáticos] a donar lo que puedan a Feeding America a través de la plataforma de YouTube. Feeding America, la organización nacional más grande que lucha contra el hambre, estima que 50 millones de personas en Estados Unidos podrían sufrir una crisis alimentaria como resultado de la pandemia este año.

At least one event in Washington featured President Donald Trump's recently pardoned former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.Rally organizers Stop The Steal, linked to pro-Trump operative Roger Stone, and church groups urged supporters to participate in Jericho Marches and prayer rallies.The protests were planned in Washington and in the capitals of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, where Trump's campaign has questioned vote counts.Trump was not expected to attend any of the protest events in D.C.MORE: https://globalnews.ca/news/7518599/trump-helicopter-washington-rally/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#Trump #GlobalNews #USElection"

That’s when Eddie Van Halen spent the day with a guy who had followed in his footsteps playing alongside David Lee Roth—Jason Becker. Jason had been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, and was not in good shape. Van Halen came to Jason’s house to give love and support—as well as a guitar—to his friend and to film an ALS awareness promotional video. During that time, Eddie told stories, talked about his creative process, and played amazing music, instantly sounding exactly like Eddie Van Halen even when playing Jason’s guitar through a small practice amp.This never-before-seen footage shows a side of Eddie Van Halen that goes far beyond his brilliant musicianship: a sweet, caring, generous personality, devoid of the trappings of fame or rock stardom. The video also documents the incredible strength of Jason Becker, who had been deprived of his shot at fame as well as his genius guitar skills, but still found the courage and the will to battle a debilitating disease.“Eddie was such a beautiful person,” says Becker. “He was incredibly kind to me and my family. Not only was he my biggest influence, he had such a huge heart. He honestly saved my life.”This video is a must-see piece of history, not just for guitarists but for everyone. It truly shows the magic of kindness, and a depth of emotion that we can all use more of.https://jasonbecker.com/Triumphant Hearts Available Now: http://smarturl.it/JasonBecker#JasonBecker #EddieVanHalen #EVH #WolfgangVanHalen #VanHalen #ALS #TriumphantHearts #HoldOnToLove"

A 2020 recipient of the Country Music Association’s Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, Pride is an inspiration to generations of performers, a model of quiet dignity and artful fortitude.Raised in the segregated South as the son of a sharecropper, Charley Frank Pride was born on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi, fifty miles south of Memphis. He spent his childhood laboring in fields, playing baseball, and listening to the Grand Ole Opry on a Philco radio. He bought his first guitar when he was fourteen, and began developing a style of singing that would come to impress his heroes.“What came from my throat was my voice, no one else’s,” he wrote in his autobiography. “No one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another — I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.”At 16, Pride left Mississippi and played baseball in the Negro American League. He was enamored of Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1947.“To say that he was my idol would be an understatement,” Pride said. “As far as I was concerned, Jackie Robinson had rewritten the future.”Pride never realized his Major League Baseball dreams, but he rewrote country music’s future. His gifts as a singer were greater than his athletic prowess. In 1962, country stars Red Sovine and Red Foley heard Pride singing in Helena, Montana, and encouraged him to come to Nashville. A year later, Pride auditioned in Nashville for manager Jack Johnson, and Johnson was astounded.Johnson introduced Pride to renegade producer Cowboy Jack Clement. On August 16, 1965, Clement took Pride to RCA’s Nashville studio and recorded demonstration recordings that impressed RCA head man Chet Atkins, who flew to Los Angeles and received approval from the label brass to sign Pride to the label.Pride’s first single, “Snakes Crawl at Night,” was released in January of 1966. Pride’s race was shielded from country radio disc jockeys until the third single, “Just Between You and Me,” climbed into the country Top Ten. The cover of his gold-selling first album, Country Charley Pride, was the first time many fans discovered that he was Black.“I get a lot of questions asked me . . . ‘Charley, how’d you get into country music and why you don’t sound like you’re supposed to sound,’” Pride said during a 1968 concert at Panther Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. “It’s a little unique, I admit. But I’ve been singing country music since I was about five-years-old. This is why I sound like I sound.” Pride responded to discrimination with square-jawed silence, determined that talent would overcome prejudice. His work spoke volumes. He was the CMA’s Entertainer of the Year in 1971, and he scored twenty-nine #1 country hits, including enduring classics “Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone,” “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’,” “All I Have to Offer You Is Me,” and “Mountain of Love.” He was named the CMA’s top male vocalist in 1971 and 1972, and was one of RCA’s top-selling artists for decades.Pride was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, seven years before his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. At the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum’s donation ceremony for Jack Clement’s guitar in 2019 Pride recalled his early recordings. He said that Clement told him, “Charley these songs we’re recording right now, fifty years from now they’re gonna be spinnin’ ‘em.”It has been more than fifty years, and those songs are still spinning."

He sent me 6 bars... we listened.. tweaked it and he finished the song in about 4 weeks. He let me know he was coming to New York for his album so i asked to shoot the vid! His publicist said he has/likes Hellcat Redeye's! When i met him he made it known he was gonna hit the drivers seat! 2 days later he passed. I have an interview i recorded that day but I'm not going to release it... no need. After Von passed we couldn’t find the session/vocals/track.

Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life’s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch’s long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon’s McMafia)—and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.Nobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch’s father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch’s brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  The film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a. (Hell or High Water, Wind River), for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu’s PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, Annie Marter and Tobey Maguire."

Claire has made tarts where the apples overcaramelized and stuck to the skillet, stayed blond and released tons of moisture, or shrunk dramatically. Differences in the freshness of apples was always the problem. In this video Claire will show you a method to help coax out some moisture to help correct those problems and leave you with a delicious tarte tatin that is every bit as good as the traditional version. Claire believes this recipe with buttery pastry, caramel, and apples can not be beat in a dessert.#ClaireSaffitz #DessertPerson #TarteTatinFOOLPROOF TARTE TATINSpecial Equipment:10-inch ovenproof skilletIngredients:7 medium or 8 Pink Lady or any sweet-tart, firm baking apples (3 lb / 1.36kg)2/3 cup maple syrup (7 oz / 200g)1/3 cup brandy (2.6 oz /74g), preferably apple brandy2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar (0.3 oz / 8g)1/2 teaspoon plus a pinch of Diamond Crystal kosher salt1 cup sugar (7 oz /200g)3 tablespoons unsalted butter (1.5 oz / 43g), cut into 1/2-inch pieces1/2 recipe Rough Puff Pastry or 1 sheet thawed frozen store-bought puff pastryAll-purpose flour, for rolling outVanilla ice cream, for servingROUGH PUFF PASTRYIngredients:3 sticks unsalted butter (12 oz / 340g), chilled3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (16 oz / 455g), plus more for rolling2 tablespoons sugar (0.9 oz / 25g)1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.16 oz / 5g)Video Breakdown:0:00 Start0:10 Intro to Tarte Tatin0:36 Show Intro / Animation0:53 Tarte Tatin Recipe1:40 Special Equipment / Ingredients3:53 Prep & Roast The Apples6:32 Rough Puff Pastry Recipe13:39 Chill The Apples & Make A Glaze15:46 Make The Caramel18:47 Roll Out & Cut The Pastry21:04 Assemble & Bake The TartFind Dessert Person Online: https://www.dessertperson.comClaire Saffitz on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/Dessert Person Merchandise: https://www.dessertperson.com/buystuffFor Other Penguin Random House Books: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/Dessert Person CookbookPhotographer: Alex LauFood Stylist: Sue LiProp Stylist: Astrid ChastkaVideo Series:Producer/Director: Vincent CrossCamera Operator: Calvin RobertsonSound Engineer/Music: Michael GugginoEditor: Brooke ShumanAnimation Credits:Character Designer/Animator: Jack SherryCharacter Rigger: Johara DuttonBackground/Prop Designer: M.
