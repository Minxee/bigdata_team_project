This has been so insanely confusing. I will be getting more tests today just to make sure these are all negative but PLEASE BE SMART DURING THIS TIME STILL!!! False positives are a thing and so are false negatives. YOU CAN HAVE COVID WITH NO SYMPTOMS. Do your part and just wear a mask. Thank you to everyone who sent me well wishes and support. I cant wait to never think about these last few days ever again.‚öâ  MERCH: https://middlekid.supply‚öâ  MERCH INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/middlekidsupply‚öâ  INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/chrisklemens‚öâ  TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@thechrisklemens?lang=en‚öâ  TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/chrisklemens‚öâ  TWITTER: https://www.twitter.com/ChrisKlemens‚öâ  DEPOP: http://depop.com/chrisklemens‚öâ  SPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/user/12158058072‚öâ  AMAZON: https://www.amazon.com/shop/chrisklemensFREE SH*T:LUPII: CHRIS20 at checkout http://getlupii.comUBER: uberchris93LYFT: chris498846GETT: GTJQQJTUBER EATS: eats-uberchris93POSTMATES: FLDCNAIRBNB: www.airbnb.com/c/chrisk15221TESLA: https://ts.la/chris75758---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BUSINESS INQUIRIES: business@chrisklemens.com (to ensure this is this the most up-to-date email, check my twitter)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MY MOST POPULAR VIDEOS:‚ñ∫ Interviewing Jake Paul's Neighbors: http://bit.ly/2tXMGiO‚ñ∫ I Paid for Trisha Paytas' Patreon: https://bit.ly/2JKGs0E‚ñ∫ The Ultimate Mukbang with Trisha Paytas: https://bit.ly/2JLS2IT‚ñ∫ Reacting to Trisha Paytas' Video About Me: https://bit.ly/32ESTm6‚ñ∫ Me Drunk vs. Me High: https://bit.ly/2Zacd8C‚ñ∫  Asking Strangers Stoner Questions: https://bit.ly/2JKGuFO---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FILMING GEAR:‚Ä¢ MAIN CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2K0bZuq‚Ä¢ MAIN CAMERA LENS: https://amzn.to/2Ya8Jln‚Ä¢ LIGHTING: https://amzn.to/2Sy4sXE‚Ä¢ VLOG CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2SA1qCi‚Ä¢ TRIPOD: https://amzn.to/2Y0dWAR‚Ä¢ VLOG CAMERA TRIPOD: https://amzn.to/2YeN0Zm‚Ä¢ MEMORY CARDS: https://amzn.to/2Sy4uPg---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My name is Chris Klemens, I live in Los Angeles (before in New York City), and make YouTube videos.

So here‚Äôs one that at first glance will make you roll your eyes, but by the end of this video, I think you‚Äôll be able to see a lot of the plausibility of things.The more I write this theory, the more it makes sense, but first we need to understand a lot of lore and backstory, so sit tight, and enjoy this one with me.In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, Mace Windu fell out of the window, and we haven‚Äôt seen the Jedi Master since. We saw a figment of his return in one of the Vader comics by Marvel which I have full coverage on with voice acting, if you can call it that, now this Mace isn‚Äôt really Mace, it‚Äôs some weird fragmented animated version of him....can we say he‚Äôs truly dead?In this theory video, I‚Äôm going to say he didn‚Äôt die that day. The theory I have behind this, is that we heard his voice speak to Rey in the rise of Skywalker. You‚Äôre probably thinking, well‚Ä¶that definitely means he‚Äôs dead, right?Sure, maybe, but, how did he speak to Rey? If it wasn‚Äôt for Qui-Gon Jinn, no one would be a force ghost. Qui-Gon Jinn met with the shaman of the whills, now these were ancient powerful beings, almost like priests of some sorts. During Qui-Gon‚Äôs life, they taught him how to transfer his essence beyond death. However, due to his untimely demise, he wasn‚Äôt able to complete his training, therefore only able to manifest his voice as a ghost, and not his body, until much later near a new hope which can be read in the book from a certain point of view. In Revenge of the Sith, Qui-Gon‚Äôs force ghost speaks to Yoda, it was cut from the film, but it was dialogued in the deleted scenes and written in the original script. That moment on Polis Massa where Yoda is meditating during Padme‚Äôs labor, to which Bail Organa, the future adopted father of Leia, interrupts Yoda‚Äôs communication with Qui-Gon. Once Padme dies and obi-wan and Yoda speak, we learn that Qui-Gon is now Yoda‚Äôs master, who has taught him how to commune with him in the force. To Obi-Wan‚Äôs surprise, Qui-Gon is still very much around in the force.So, where did he go? The Star Wars galaxy is huge, and it‚Äôs possible that he fled somewhere, or went in hiding, just like Yoda, Obi-Wan and the rest of the survivors of Order 66. What if he went somewhere to some unknown planet in the unknown regions somewhere to hide and train more Jedi? What if he became a Mandalorian? Nothing would suit his scarred and recognizable face better than hiding under a helmet. This leads me to my next theory, what if Mace Windu is in The Mandalorian? What if he shows up in season2 or 3 or more? Mace Windu was unbelievably powerful, so powerful that he went toe to toe with the Emperor.Now, if Mace is alive, seeing him as a Mandalorian would not just be cool, it would fit a lot of the story for the Jedi that could help reunite the child with his species. There is no person in the galaxy that knows Yoda better than Mace Windu. He sat with him as second in command, and in some cases, first in command. Mace in a lot of ways, was the chosen one. He used the light and the dark, he was the master of his emotions, and he had surpassed all of his teachers as a young boy, growing to become the most powerful Jedi just before Anakin could see his full potential until he lost to OBiWan.Let‚Äôs say Mando takes The Child to Ahsoka, and she eventually tells him of someone who can really show him the way to reuniting the Child with its species, pointing him to another Easter egg hunt throughout the galaxy, to Mace Windu.Mace could be laying low, perhaps growing his crops and training those who exhibited force powers at an early age. Perfecting his abilities and learning more about all aspects of the force, and eventually along the way, learning a ton from Yoda who communed with him, and Obi-Wan after their deaths. Perhaps even, coming across Luke Skywalker and learning of the fate of Anakin and the Emperor. Teaching Luke so much about his father‚Äôs youth.This could be Mace‚Äôs return, this could be how Mace fits into the Mandalorian. So you‚Äôre probably saying, well ok, but what about his death‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶What if while the Mando is finding the path to Mace Windu, he is followed by someone notorious flying the Slave 1 ship and once he does leave Mace, with the information on where to reunite The Child with his parents, Boba comes to him. How poetic would it be if Mace Windu‚Äôs death came full circle, and what I mean is, Boba Fett finds him, and kills him, transcending him into the force‚Ä¶avenging his father, Jango.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/joinedited @Star Wars Elseworlds thumbnail @Benny Productions music @Samuel Kim Music"

Baby Yoda, The Child is being used for his force sensitivity, to transfer that to another body. While all tests haven't succeeded, Moff Gideon and Dr. Pershing are committed to making it happen. This is interesting as I think they could even search Luke Skywalker for his force sensitivity and high midichlorian count. I was happy to hear about the M-Count which we haven't heard of since Qui-Gon Jinn mentioned them in The Phantom Menace when he tested Anakin and sent the sample to Obi-Wan Kenobi.This episode took alot of elements from Jedi Knight II which was interesting to see.Cloning force sensitives is a hard feat, something that Palpatine and Dooku could not do with General Grievous. Something Vader couldn't do with Galen Marek in The Force Unleashed II. It seems, though, that Snoke was created via this process, and maybe his force sensitivity was granted from The Child, which feels weird. Or perhaps, it's from someone else...Luke? Ahsoka? Another force user?I'm excited for Episode 5 to finally see Ahsoka Tano and hopefully Boba Fett and Bo Katan later one (maybe Ezra and Sabine too).A wild theory I have, is that Mace Windu could appear...I'll have a full video on it tomorrow for you...Let me know what you thought of the episode!Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join"
