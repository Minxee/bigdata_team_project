That‚Äôs when Eddie Van Halen spent the day with a guy who had followed in his footsteps playing alongside David Lee Roth‚ÄîJason Becker. Jason had been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig‚Äôs Disease, and was not in good shape. Van Halen came to Jason‚Äôs house to give love and support‚Äîas well as a guitar‚Äîto his friend and to film an ALS awareness promotional video. During that time, Eddie told stories, talked about his creative process, and played amazing music, instantly sounding exactly like Eddie Van Halen even when playing Jason‚Äôs guitar through a small practice amp.This never-before-seen footage shows a side of Eddie Van Halen that goes far beyond his brilliant musicianship: a sweet, caring, generous personality, devoid of the trappings of fame or rock stardom. The video also documents the incredible strength of Jason Becker, who had been deprived of his shot at fame as well as his genius guitar skills, but still found the courage and the will to battle a debilitating disease.‚ÄúEddie was such a beautiful person,‚Äù says Becker. ‚ÄúHe was incredibly kind to me and my family. Not only was he my biggest influence, he had such a huge heart. He honestly saved my life.‚ÄùThis video is a must-see piece of history, not just for guitarists but for everyone. It truly shows the magic of kindness, and a depth of emotion that we can all use more of.https://jasonbecker.com/Triumphant Hearts Available Now: http://smarturl.it/JasonBecker#JasonBecker #EddieVanHalen #EVH #WolfgangVanHalen #VanHalen #ALS #TriumphantHearts #HoldOnToLove"

A 2020 recipient of the Country Music Association‚Äôs Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, Pride is an inspiration to generations of performers, a model of quiet dignity and artful fortitude.Raised in the segregated South as the son of a sharecropper, Charley Frank Pride was born on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi, fifty miles south of Memphis. He spent his childhood laboring in fields, playing baseball, and listening to the Grand Ole Opry on a Philco radio. He bought his first guitar when he was fourteen, and began developing a style of singing that would come to impress his heroes.‚ÄúWhat came from my throat was my voice, no one else‚Äôs,‚Äù he wrote in his autobiography. ‚ÄúNo one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another ‚Äî I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.‚ÄùAt 16, Pride left Mississippi and played baseball in the Negro American League. He was enamored of Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball‚Äôs color barrier in 1947.‚ÄúTo say that he was my idol would be an understatement,‚Äù Pride said. ‚ÄúAs far as I was concerned, Jackie Robinson had rewritten the future.‚ÄùPride never realized his Major League Baseball dreams, but he rewrote country music‚Äôs future. His gifts as a singer were greater than his athletic prowess. In 1962, country stars Red Sovine and Red Foley heard Pride singing in Helena, Montana, and encouraged him to come to Nashville. A year later, Pride auditioned in Nashville for manager Jack Johnson, and Johnson was astounded.Johnson introduced Pride to renegade producer Cowboy Jack Clement. On August 16, 1965, Clement took Pride to RCA‚Äôs Nashville studio and recorded demonstration recordings that impressed RCA head man Chet Atkins, who flew to Los Angeles and received approval from the label brass to sign Pride to the label.Pride‚Äôs first single, ‚ÄúSnakes Crawl at Night,‚Äù was released in January of 1966. Pride‚Äôs race was shielded from country radio disc jockeys until the third single, ‚ÄúJust Between You and Me,‚Äù climbed into the country Top Ten. The cover of his gold-selling first album, Country Charley Pride, was the first time many fans discovered that he was Black.‚ÄúI get a lot of questions asked me . . . ‚ÄòCharley, how‚Äôd you get into country music and why you don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre supposed to sound,‚Äô‚Äù Pride said during a 1968 concert at Panther Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little unique, I admit. But I‚Äôve been singing country music since I was about five-years-old. This is why I sound like I sound.‚Äù Pride responded to discrimination with square-jawed silence, determined that talent would overcome prejudice. His work spoke volumes. He was the CMA‚Äôs Entertainer of the Year in 1971, and he scored twenty-nine #1 country hits, including enduring classics ‚ÄúIs Anybody Goin‚Äô to San Antone,‚Äù ‚ÄúKiss an Angel Good Mornin‚Äô,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll I Have to Offer You Is Me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMountain of Love.‚Äù He was named the CMA‚Äôs top male vocalist in 1971 and 1972, and was one of RCA‚Äôs top-selling artists for decades.Pride was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, seven years before his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. At the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum‚Äôs donation ceremony for Jack Clement‚Äôs guitar in 2019 Pride recalled his early recordings. He said that Clement told him, ‚ÄúCharley these songs we‚Äôre recording right now, fifty years from now they‚Äôre gonna be spinnin‚Äô ‚Äòem.‚ÄùIt has been more than fifty years, and those songs are still spinning."

Claire has made tarts where the apples overcaramelized and stuck to the skillet, stayed blond and released tons of moisture, or shrunk dramatically. Differences in the freshness of apples was always the problem. In this video Claire will show you a method to help coax out some moisture to help correct those problems and leave you with a delicious tarte tatin that is every bit as good as the traditional version.

So we went to Rotiform to find out what it takes to make a good wheel....and a horrible wheel. There have been many notoriously bad wheel designs throughout the last few decades. We pulled from one of the most iconic of this group to create what we now call the Aint Care Bear.  Jason from Rotiform had it machined on the spot, we wrapped it in Toyo Proxes rubber, and then gave it a proper Hoonigan style break-in. Its ridiculous, its dumb, but its also kind of awesome if you're into that sort of thing.

Flanked by personal memorabilia supplied by their mother, the Bailey sisters did their best to make this studio performance really feel like a home concert.As they volley off each other, swapping lead and harmonies, it's amazing to watch how years of practice and innate genetic chemistry have them synced tighter than a SMPTE timecode. Baby Girl, the second song here, starts with notes reminiscent of Crystal Waters' Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless), and is preceded with Chloe sharing I know this year 2020 has been absolutely bonkers for all of us. For those moments where you kinda feel less than and you're not good enough ... that's why we wrote this song. ... Whatever happens, we'll be OK. And this is our world.

Both sides were still vying for a spot in the knockout stage and RB Leipzig made their presence known jumping out to a three goal lead but Manchester United staged a late comeback that with a Bruno Fernandes goal in the 80‚Äô and a Paul Pogba goal in the 82‚Äô but it was too little too late and Leipzig got the win.  Leipzig wasted no time scoring in this match as Angelino opened things up in the 2‚Äô. From there, they doubled their lead in the 13‚Äô with a Haidara goal, they held onto that 2-0 lead going into half. In the 69‚Äô Leipzig tacked on a much needed third goal when Kluivert found the back of the net. Man. United got one back when Bruno Fernandes powered it home from the penalty spot in the 80‚Äô to cut the Leipzig lead to 3-1. Then just two minutes later Paul Pogba, who had come on as a substitute, gave Manchester United life when he headed one home to cut the lead to one. That would be all the English side could muster, unable to find the back of the net in the match‚Äôs final minutes and with Leipzig holding on for the win, Manchester United will not advance to the UEFA Champions League knockout stage.

The initial idea was to have the player itself be a smaller copy of the level that can navigate inside itself. So you could do things to the level to give yourself certain abilities or do things to yourself to modify the level. There weren't many amazing directions to take this, so I thought of something else:What if the level contained a smaller copy of itself, and the player character can navigate between the different recursive instances. The idea is cool I guess, but programming it turned out to be quite the challenge - ultimately involving the use of a render texture and quickly swapping out the controlled player copy.The final 2D golf based game is full of some mind-bending mechanics involving scaling the player, changing gravity, and duplicating yourself. --- MUSIC ---‚Üí Sidearm by INTL.CMD - https://soundcloud.com/intlcmd‚Üí Pookatori and Friends by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)‚Üí Crazy by Antti Luode"
