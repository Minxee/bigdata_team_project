Dave Filoni directed this and he did an amazing job.As we see the barren forest land of Corvus, we spot a major Easter egg, which is the Owl, Morai. Morai is the daughter. For those who haven‚Äôt watched the clone wars, then you‚Äôll want to watch my video I made on her (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_c8JNUSts) which explains everything about her and Mortis.Ahsoka shows up and fights Mando, which ends quick after Mando tells her he was sent by Bo Katan.As she looks at Baby Yoda, our episode really begins.Ahsoka and Baby Yoda talk over the moonlight, where she reveals his name is Grogu. She says they can feel each other‚Äôs thoughts.He was raised at the Jedi temple on coruscant. Many masters trained him over the years. At the end of the clone wars, he was hidden. Someone took him from the temple, then his memory becomes dark.He was lost and alone. So someone has taken his memory. I think there are three people here who could have taken him. One being Mace Windu. Perhaps Mace went directly to the Temple after he fell, and collected Grogu. Or it was Palpatine, who had taken him and that‚Äôs why his memory is dark, because maybe he tried to wipe his mind of things, vital things that had to do with the experiments done on Grogu. Or, Jocastu Nu took him, the librarian. Now, she could have taken him, and when she died months after revenge of the Sith, to Vader, which I‚Äôve covered in a video from the marvel comic, I‚Äôll also link below for you, Grogu was on his own and he had to suppress his powers heavily in order to survive. Like Obi-Wan and Yoda did, so that the empire will not find him.The next day Ahsoka trains Grogu, or at least tries. She failed to get Grogu to summon the stone, where Mando tries to get him to summon the knob of the ship‚Äôs shifter. It works and Grogu takes the knob with the force. Ahsoka realizes they have a strong bond, and says she can‚Äôt train him, for his attachment to Din is too strong. The entire tone of the episode changes when she tells him she‚Äôs seen what attachments do to a fully trained Jedi Knight, she is referring to Anakin Skywalker here, who turned to the dark side due to his attachment to Padme and trying to saver her from dying in child birth, which I would argue, was just a dream put into his head by Palpatine. Din makes a deal with her, that she promises to train the child if he helps her defeat the village who hired him to kill her.Ahsoka and Din Djarin take out the town.Facing the magistrate, she toys with her and disarms her, and demands to know where Grand Admiral Thrawn is.Thrawn is out there.Anyhow, the village is freed, and Mando goes to fetch Grogu to give him up to Ahsoka so he can be trained. Meeting him back at his ship, Ahsoka tells Din that she cannot train Grogu. The attachment he has to Din is far too strong. Mando tells him that a deal is a deal, and she alters the deal, but tells him of another way, she tells him to go to Tython, there he will find the ancient ruins of a temple that is strong in the force, place him atop the mountain on the seeing stone, so that Grogu may choose his path. If he reaches out in the force, a Jedi will sense his presence and come looking for him. In my opinion, this Jedi, is Luke Skywalker. I think what will happen is that Luke, who is getting ready to start building his new temple of Jedi students, will feel Grogu and will reach back out to him, to which the connection will be broken by the interference and arrival of Moff Gideon, who has tracked Mando to Tython and unleashes the dark troopers upon him and Grogu. I believe he‚Äôll then kidnap Grogu to kill him for his blood, where Luke Skywalker will come into the scene somehow to help Din get back the child.I think this will all lead to Luke Skywalker who will train Grogu, but not before Moff Gideon takes him from The Mandalorian!Thrawn top 10 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD77ZsEwhX4The Daughter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_c8JNUStsBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join"

A masterpiece is created from the beautiful harmony of retro sounds generated by strings, brass, and vocoder mixed with the dreamlike sound from the synthesizer. The vocal chopping elements heard within the intro are arranged throughout the song to make the single even more charismatic. You can once again experience the charm of CHUNG HA‚Äôs deep mid to low vocals, as heard in her recent single ‚ÄòBad Boy.‚Äù This single ‚ÄúDream of You (with R3HAB)‚Äù will excite your ears once again'Ï≤≠Ìïò' ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏ†ÅÏù∏ DJ & ÌîÑÎ°úÎìÄÏÑú ‚ÄòR3HAB'Í≥º Ïª¨ÎûòÎ≤ÑÎ†àÏù¥ÏÖò Ïã±Í∏ÄÏùÑ Î∞úÎß§ÌïúÎã§.[Dream of You (with R3HAB)]Îäî ÌïòÏö∞Ïä§ Î¶¨Îì¨Í≥º ÏÑ†Ïù¥ ÍµµÏùÄ Î≤†Ïù¥Ïä§ ÎùºÏù∏Ïù¥ Ïù¥ÎÅÑÎäî ÏùºÎ†âÌä∏Î°úÎãâ Ïû•Î•¥Ïùò Í≥°Ïù¥Îã§.Ïä§Ìä∏ÎßÅ, Î∏åÎùºÏä§, Î≥¥ÏΩîÎçîÏùò Î†àÌä∏Î°úÌïú ÏÇ¨Ïö¥ÎìúÏôÄ Î™ΩÌôòÏ†ÅÏù∏ Ïã†ÎîîÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ï†Ä ÏÇ¨Ïö¥ÎìúÍ∞Ä Ïñ¥Ïö∞Îü¨Ï†∏ Í±∞Ïπ†ÏßÄÎßå ÏïÑÎ¶ÑÎã§Ïö¥ ÌïòÎÇòÏùò ÏûëÌíàÏù¥ ÏôÑÏÑ±ÎêòÏóàÎã§.

Maradona played for Boca Juniors, Barcelona and Napoli in a storied club career, and later managed Argentina at the 2010 World Cup.Declaring three days of national mourning, Alberto Fern√°ndez, the president of Argentina, said: 'You took us to the top of the world.

Dynamo Kyiv had to come out victorious in this one to stay in the hunt for qualification. Early in the second half, Barcelona came out firing. Sergi√±o Dest, who is the first American to ever play for Barcelona, gave his side the 1-0 lead with a goal in the 52‚Äô marking his first goal since December 2019 back when he was playing for Ajax. Then just a few minutes later, Barcelona doubled its lead with a Martin Braithwaite goal in the 57‚Äô. Barcelona kept their foot on the gas as they laid on another goal in the 70‚Äô when Braithwaite put away his penalty shot to notch his second goal of the evening. Dest almost notched his second goal of the match in the 88‚Äô put sailed it just a bit high. In the 90'+2 Antoine Griezmann added one more goal for insurance to secure the 4-0 win for the Spanish side. Barcelona would hold on to win 3-0 over Dynamo Kyiv and with the loss, Dynamo Kyiv was eliminated from contention.

In the 70‚Äô the ball came to Ronaldo‚Äôs feet as he timed his run perfectly, he got behind the very last line and just had the keeper to beat and the Ferencvaros keeper barely got his hand on the ball as Ronaldo dribbled past and denied the opportunity. Juventus had one final opportunity in stoppage time to win the game. √Ålvaro Morata put it away in the 90‚Äô+2 to give Juventus the 2-1 late. The late goal was cause for celebration for Juventus, but Ferencvaros was heartbreaking as they stood toe to toe with the strong Juventus side.

Kenny G - In Your Eyes | ¬†Vevo Official Live PerformanceThe Weeknd's 'After Hours' is one of those albums that paints vivid pictures. Abel Tesfaye's music has a dark radiance that's both dreamy and eerie, and the record's videos flaunt their sensuality with a macabre grace. So we were thrilled to work with the singer and their team on three exclusive performances from the 'After Hours' song list. We kicked off our roll-out with Alone Again. Now it's time for In Your Eyes, which boasts a very cool Kenny G feature on soprano sax. Tomorrow we wrap it up with Faith.
