In the 13’ Ronaldo opened the scoring when he found the back of the net from the penalty spot. Then just 7 minutes later, Weston McKennie, the US Men’s National Team player, doubled the Juventus lead when acrobatically parked one in the net. Ronaldo was not finished with his day of scoring as he powered another home from the penalty spot yet again in the 52’. All match Barcelona was unable to finish their chances and Juventus took advantage, winning 3-0 in decisive fashion. Both sides will advance to the Round of 16.

Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life’s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch’s long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon’s McMafia)—and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.Nobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch’s father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch’s brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  The film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a. (Hell or High Water, Wind River), for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu’s PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, Annie Marter and Tobey Maguire."

Claire has made tarts where the apples overcaramelized and stuck to the skillet, stayed blond and released tons of moisture, or shrunk dramatically. Differences in the freshness of apples was always the problem. In this video Claire will show you a method to help coax out some moisture to help correct those problems and leave you with a delicious tarte tatin that is every bit as good as the traditional version.

For those moments where you kinda feel less than and you're not good enough ... that's why we wrote this song. ... Whatever happens, we'll be OK. And this is our world.

Both sides were still vying for a spot in the knockout stage and RB Leipzig made their presence known jumping out to a three goal lead but Manchester United staged a late comeback that with a Bruno Fernandes goal in the 80’ and a Paul Pogba goal in the 82’ but it was too little too late and Leipzig got the win.  Leipzig wasted no time scoring in this match as Angelino opened things up in the 2’. From there, they doubled their lead in the 13’ with a Haidara goal, they held onto that 2-0 lead going into half. In the 69’ Leipzig tacked on a much needed third goal when Kluivert found the back of the net. Man. United got one back when Bruno Fernandes powered it home from the penalty spot in the 80’ to cut the Leipzig lead to 3-1. Then just two minutes later Paul Pogba, who had come on as a substitute, gave Manchester United life when he headed one home to cut the lead to one. That would be all the English side could muster, unable to find the back of the net in the match’s final minutes and with Leipzig holding on for the win, Manchester United will not advance to the UEFA Champions League knockout stage.

Scene #1 ‘Color of Youth’ 우리들의 청춘과 아름다운 순간의 찰나Scene #2 ‘Becoming One’ 서로가 서로를 통해 비로소 갖게 되는 우리라는 의미Scene #3 ‘Stay Bold’ 함께일 때 가장 화려하게 빛나는 우리“Shoot! Take a Panorama”타이틀곡 ‘Panorama’는 찬란한 순간을 영원히 기억하겠다는 이야기를 담은 가사로, 풍경이 그려지는 아름다운 편곡과 감성적이면서 고급스러운 멜로디 라인이 인상적인 팝 하우스 장르의 곡이다. 세 가지 신(Scene)의 흐름에서 귀결되는 ‘우리’의 의미와 상통한다.That's the Sequence디스코(Disco)와 신스팝(Synth-Pop) 기반의 댄스곡으로, 곡의 파트마다 조금씩 변하는 악기 구성이 독특한 곡이다. 연속적인 사건, 순서를 뜻하는 사전적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence)와 신(Scene)들이 모여 하나의 이야기를 나타내는 영화적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence). 이 두 가지 의미를 모두 가사에 녹여냈다.이 밖에 영화를 연상케 하는 제목의 수록곡 '미장센(Mise-en-Scène)', 아이즈원 특유의 밝은 에너지를 담은 'Island', 강렬한 드럼사운드의 'O Sole Mio', 위즈원과의 함께하는 시간이 빠르게 지나 아쉬워 조금 더 느리게 즐기고 싶은 마음을 담은 멤버 김채원 자작곡 '느린 여행'이 트랙리스트를 풍부하게 만들었다.이처럼 [One-reeler / Act IV]는 각각의 영화적 장치 같은 수록곡들이 앨범의 구성을 풍성하게 뒷받침하여 아이즈원만의 색깔로 현재 진행 중인 성장 스토리를 보여주고 있다."

The initial idea was to have the player itself be a smaller copy of the level that can navigate inside itself. So you could do things to the level to give yourself certain abilities or do things to yourself to modify the level. There weren't many amazing directions to take this, so I thought of something else:What if the level contained a smaller copy of itself, and the player character can navigate between the different recursive instances. The idea is cool I guess, but programming it turned out to be quite the challenge - ultimately involving the use of a render texture and quickly swapping out the controlled player copy.The final 2D golf based game is full of some mind-bending mechanics involving scaling the player, changing gravity, and duplicating yourself. --- MUSIC ---→ Sidearm by INTL.CMD - https://soundcloud.com/intlcmd→ Pookatori and Friends by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)→ Crazy by Antti Luode"

Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire was a massive success, and so it made sense to start tackling some other Marvel properties. However, studios didn’t exactly know what to do with comic book movies just yet. Thus was born Ang Lee’s slow-burn, slow-paced Hulk movie in 2003 with the weirdest editing transitions known to man.Ang Lee’s hulk definitely raises some questions. Like why does it take so long to see the Hulk? Why is a movie about a giant green monster that smashes things so slow-paced? What’s up with Hulk fighting dogs? Why is everybody surviving these catastrophic attacks from the Hulk? And seriously, what’s with this editing?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Hulk!

Y de pensar que duermas en otros brazosmi corazón está en pedazos.Y es que no me acostumbroa no estar contigo. No soporto extrañartey olvidarte no consigo. (x2)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)(Ozuna)Y tú eres mía nada más.Qué te parece si lo repetimos,aquello que algún día nosotros quisimos. Abrimos una botella de vino.No me sorprende qué pase, así es el destino.Qué más tú quieres de mí,hay una vida con amorpuedo hacerte feliz.Sé que hay muchos que comentan mal de mípero no saben que yo doy mi vida por ti.Y es que no me acostumbroa no estar contigo. No soporto extrañartey olvidarte no consigo. (x2)(Siempre que me doy un trago)Y empiezo a recordarte sin ropa,chocando las copas y yo acariciándote. (ohh)Tu mirada, tu pelo y tu boca,te volvías loca y yo seduciéndote.(Bebé déjate llevar por el lobo)Tantos recuerdos que me siento preso de verdad.Mi mente es una vellonera y tengo la canción pegá.Sin darle al GYM ‘toy duro pero tú eres mi debilidad.Sin ti vivo en una burbuja de ansiedad.Porque es un castigoimaginar que alguien duerme contigo y que en las noches sea tu abrigo.Como DY baby sígueme y te sigo.Vente conmigo.Es que el location de tus labios no lo necesito,sé dónde es, si siempre ha sido mi spot favorito.Ahora que no te tengo cómo te explicoque tú eras la jugadora estrella de mi equipo. (I’m done)(Miky Woodz)El olor de tu pelo en la cama no lo olvido.Hay días que me quiero morir,hay otros positivos.Todos me preguntan: Doble ¿por qué tan pensativo?Ellos no saben que el amor de mi vida se ha ido.Y no quiere volver,no quiere responder.Yo estoy seguro que tú no me dejaste de querer.Mi boca extraña tu boca,mi cuerpo extraña tu piel;como te volvías loca cuando te daba placer.Y es que no me acostumbroa no estar contigo. No soporto extrañartey olvidarte no consigo. (x2)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más.

L is targeted for 11:17 a.m. EST, or 16:17 UTC. Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about eleven minutes after liftoff and autonomously dock to the space station on Monday, December 7.  This is the first flight of the updated cargo version of Dragon, which is capable of carrying about 20 percent more volume than the previous version of Dragon and has double the amount of powered locker cargo capability. Dragon is now designed for up to five flights to and from the space station, and this cargo version of the spacecraft can stay on station for a duration more than twice as long as the previous version of Dragon. The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this launch previously supported launch of Dragon’s first flight with NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (Demo-2), the ANASIS-II mission, and a Starlink mission. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean."

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Dec. 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- With a genuine smile stretched across her face, Dua Lipa seems overjoyed to reconnect with her band for their only performance since their tour in support of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, was cancelled in March. Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of levitating and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.While we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our home series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape. Dua sums the times during her intro of Love Again: It's about manifesting good things into your life, when things aren't quite going your way.SET LISTLevitatingPretty PleaseLove AgainDon't Start NowMUSICIANSDua Lipa: vocalsMatthew Carroll: bassAlex Lanyon: guitarNaomi Scarlett: vocalsCiara O'Connor: vocalsIzzy Chase: vocalsMatthew Allen: vocalsCREDITSVideo: Ceremony London, James BarnesAudio: WFB Live, Will NicholsonTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Abby O'NeillVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinAssociate ProducerTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"
