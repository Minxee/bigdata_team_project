In the 13’ Ronaldo opened the scoring when he found the back of the net from the penalty spot. Then just 7 minutes later, Weston McKennie, the US Men’s National Team player, doubled the Juventus lead when acrobatically parked one in the net. Ronaldo was not finished with his day of scoring as he powered another home from the penalty spot yet again in the 52’.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Abby O'Neill | December 8, 2020Powerful sister duo Chloe x Halle went all out on this one. Flanked by personal memorabilia supplied by their mother, the Bailey sisters did their best to make this studio performance really feel like a home concert.As they volley off each other, swapping lead and harmonies, it's amazing to watch how years of practice and innate genetic chemistry have them synced tighter than a SMPTE timecode. Baby Girl, the second song here, starts with notes reminiscent of Crystal Waters' Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless), and is preceded with Chloe sharing I know this year 2020 has been absolutely bonkers for all of us. For those moments where you kinda feel less than and you're not good enough ... that's why we wrote this song. ... Whatever happens, we'll be OK. And this is our world. Fusing R&B, soul and pop, backed by a talented nine-piece female band, this performance is surely to delight Chloe x Halle's global fanbase.SET LISTDon't Make It Harder on MeBaby GirlDo ItUngodly HourWonder What She Thinks of MeMUSICIANSChloe Bailey: vocalsHalle Bailey: vocalsElise Solberg: keyboardElin Sandberg: bassLexii Lynn Frazier: guitarBrandi Singleton: drumsArnetta Johnson: trumpetCrystal Torres: trumpetStephanie Yu: violinChelsea Stevens: celloMarta Honer: violaCREDITSVideo: Ben Hagerty, Darin ConradAudio: Lester Mendoza, Derek Dixie, Stephen CurtainDirector: Ben HagertyCamera Operator: Darin ConradEditor: Nia PhillipsCreative Direction: Andrew MakadsiArt Director: Brianna GonzalesAssistant Art Director: Ian MiyawakiTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Abby O'NeillVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinAssociate Producer: Bobby CarterTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

Scene #1 ‘Color of Youth’ 우리들의 청춘과 아름다운 순간의 찰나Scene #2 ‘Becoming One’ 서로가 서로를 통해 비로소 갖게 되는 우리라는 의미Scene #3 ‘Stay Bold’ 함께일 때 가장 화려하게 빛나는 우리“Shoot! Take a Panorama”타이틀곡 ‘Panorama’는 찬란한 순간을 영원히 기억하겠다는 이야기를 담은 가사로, 풍경이 그려지는 아름다운 편곡과 감성적이면서 고급스러운 멜로디 라인이 인상적인 팝 하우스 장르의 곡이다. 세 가지 신(Scene)의 흐름에서 귀결되는 ‘우리’의 의미와 상통한다.That's the Sequence디스코(Disco)와 신스팝(Synth-Pop) 기반의 댄스곡으로, 곡의 파트마다 조금씩 변하는 악기 구성이 독특한 곡이다. 연속적인 사건, 순서를 뜻하는 사전적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence)와 신(Scene)들이 모여 하나의 이야기를 나타내는 영화적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence). 이 두 가지 의미를 모두 가사에 녹여냈다.이 밖에 영화를 연상케 하는 제목의 수록곡 '미장센(Mise-en-Scène)', 아이즈원 특유의 밝은 에너지를 담은 'Island', 강렬한 드럼사운드의 'O Sole Mio', 위즈원과의 함께하는 시간이 빠르게 지나 아쉬워 조금 더 느리게 즐기고 싶은 마음을 담은 멤버 김채원 자작곡 '느린 여행'이 트랙리스트를 풍부하게 만들었다.이처럼 [One-reeler / Act IV]는 각각의 영화적 장치 같은 수록곡들이 앨범의 구성을 풍성하게 뒷받침하여 아이즈원만의 색깔로 현재 진행 중인 성장 스토리를 보여주고 있다."

Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire was a massive success, and so it made sense to start tackling some other Marvel properties. However, studios didn’t exactly know what to do with comic book movies just yet. Thus was born Ang Lee’s slow-burn, slow-paced Hulk movie in 2003 with the weirdest editing transitions known to man.Ang Lee’s hulk definitely raises some questions. Like why does it take so long to see the Hulk? Why is a movie about a giant green monster that smashes things so slow-paced? What’s up with Hulk fighting dogs? Why is everybody surviving these catastrophic attacks from the Hulk? And seriously, what’s with this editing?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Hulk!

The initial idea was to have the player itself be a smaller copy of the level that can navigate inside itself. So you could do things to the level to give yourself certain abilities or do things to yourself to modify the level. There weren't many amazing directions to take this, so I thought of something else:What if the level contained a smaller copy of itself, and the player character can navigate between the different recursive instances. The idea is cool I guess, but programming it turned out to be quite the challenge - ultimately involving the use of a render texture and quickly swapping out the controlled player copy.The final 2D golf based game is full of some mind-bending mechanics involving scaling the player, changing gravity, and duplicating yourself. --- MUSIC ---→ Sidearm by INTL.CMD - https://soundcloud.com/intlcmd→ Pookatori and Friends by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)→ Crazy by Antti Luode"

L is targeted for 11:17 a.m. EST, or 16:17 UTC. Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about eleven minutes after liftoff and autonomously dock to the space station on Monday, December 7.  This is the first flight of the updated cargo version of Dragon, which is capable of carrying about 20 percent more volume than the previous version of Dragon and has double the amount of powered locker cargo capability. Dragon is now designed for up to five flights to and from the space station, and this cargo version of the spacecraft can stay on station for a duration more than twice as long as the previous version of Dragon. The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this launch previously supported launch of Dragon’s first flight with NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (Demo-2), the ANASIS-II mission, and a Starlink mission. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean."

(I’m done)(Miky Woodz)El olor de tu pelo en la cama no lo olvido.Hay días que me quiero morir,hay otros positivos.Todos me preguntan: Doble ¿por qué tan pensativo?Ellos no saben que el amor de mi vida se ha ido.Y no quiere volver,no quiere responder.Yo estoy seguro que tú no me dejaste de querer.Mi boca extraña tu boca,mi cuerpo extraña tu piel;como te volvías loca cuando te daba placer.Y es que no me acostumbroa no estar contigo.

If you've never tried making a DIY gingerbread house before, don't let this video scare you, you definitely should! It's a really fun activity to do with friends and family where you can get creative. Also, no matte how ugly it turns out, it always tastes good 😂 . There are always tons of make your own gingerbread house kits available around this time of year. But make sure you get plenty of extra frosting and candy for decorating!! 🤣 Anyway, sorry that this project didn't turn out exactly how I was hoping. I hope you enjoy it anyway, and mayyyyybe you'll get some tips on how to decorate a gingerbread house and how NOT to decorate a gingerbread house 🤣  I am hoping to do at least one more christmas themed art project this season, so make sure you stick around for that!___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of levitating and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.While we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our home series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape. Dua sums the times during her intro of Love Again: It's about manifesting good things into your life, when things aren't quite going your way.SET LISTLevitatingPretty PleaseLove AgainDon't Start NowMUSICIANSDua Lipa: vocalsMatthew Carroll: bassAlex Lanyon: guitarNaomi Scarlett: vocalsCiara O'Connor: vocalsIzzy Chase: vocalsMatthew Allen: vocalsCREDITSVideo: Ceremony London, James BarnesAudio: WFB Live, Will NicholsonTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Abby O'NeillVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinAssociate ProducerTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 finally shows the one and only, Boba Fett in the spotlight. We see Boba return and eventually help Din Djarin and Grogu against Moff Gideon's Storm Troopers and Dark Troopers (phase 2 I think), who end up taking Grogu.Fennec Shand reminds me a lot of Zam Wessel from Attack of the Clones, who was pursued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, until Jango showed up.We also learn a lot about Jango Fett, Boba Fett's Father. We learn that Jango Fett was a Mandalorian! This is awesome! Since it was skewed in canon, it's nice to know we finally have an answer. They seem to be following his story from Open Seasons comic book series which shows the story of Jango as a boy. Long story short, Jango was the son of a farmer on Concord Dawn. A man named Jaster Mereel who was leader of the True Mandalorians, was on the run from a traitor named Tor Vizsla from Death Watch. Jango’s dad hid Jaster Mereel in his farm, and told Jango that he was feeding some homeless men. When Tor Vizsla came looking near Jango’s Dad’s farm, he found Jango’s Dad and beat him up infant of Jango, until Jango’s mom created a distraction and Jango ran for his life, leaving his parents who were immediately murdered, Fett ran into Jaster Mereel who eventually took the boy under his wing and recruited him in the Mandalorian Civil War against Death Watch, as one of the True Mandalorians. Jaster died eventually and Jango avenged him, becoming the leader of the True Mandalorians. Now the people who found Din, were death watch, so the two clans have always been waging wars against one another and have varying beliefs. Explaining this to Din, Din accepts that the armour belongs to Boba. So this armour, is just repainted from his dad’s, from Jango’s. The deal is done, says Din, where Boba assures him that it is not, as he promised the safety of the child in return for his armour. Now Boba joins the crew until the child is safe. Flying in the Slave 1, they arrive on Nevarro 7, where Cara Dune is now a New Republic Marshal, where he asks her to locate Mayfeld, who you might remember from season 1. Mando is going to spring him out of jail to locate Moff Gideon’s cruiser.We jump to Moff Gideon’s light cruiser, he walks to the cell containing the child.As Moff Gideon enters, we see Grogu using the force on stormtroopers. Even going as far as using force choke, to which many might think is a dark side move, but, I should mention, Luke Skywalker used it as well in Return of the Jedi, and he was far from the dark side.As Grogu knocks them out, Gideon steps up to him and ignites his dark saber, asking Grogu if he remembers one of these, meaning if he remembers using a lightsaber or having seen many lightsabers during his time as a Jedi at the Jedi Temple before Order 66. Grogu is tired, I think because he had to cut himself off from the force for so long that he isn’t used to using it as much as when he was at the Jedi temple learning from the many masters. Using the force can also tire one out, like it does to Luke in the empire strikes back when failing to lift the x-wing out of Yoda’s swamp. They blast Grogu with a stun blast, and cuff him. Gideon tells his officer to contact Dr. Pershing, the cloning doctor responsible for the experiments on the child, to tell him that they have their donor. The plan now is for Gideon to kill Grogu to harvest all of his blood which has force powers, or in Star Wars lingo, a high Midichlorian count. End of the episode.It was amazing. Simply amazing. My favourite episode of the entire show so far, which is saying a lot. Boba is back and badder than ever, as Terry Silver would say. I think the next episode will revolve around rescuing Mayfeld from Jail, and then tracking the light cruiser or going to Dr. Pershing who will have the child momentarily. I think the season finale will end in a Big Bang all out battle like end game. With everyone we’ve seen from this season fighting together against Moff Gideon and his dark troopers, as he himself gets in a phase 3 dark trooper mega suit to destroy Din. Hopefully Ahsoka Tano returns with Bo Katan, and we get to see another Jedi, Luke or Ezra is my guess.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join"

Najee Harris punched it in from 11 yards out to give the Crimson Tide a 52-14 lead midway through the third for their only score of the quarter. Harris has three touchdowns on the night and has racked up a whopping 145 yards. The story of the game, however, is Crimson Tide receiver DeVonta Smith. The senior has eight catches for 231 yards and three touchdowns -- all of which came in the first half. The third of those touchdowns came in the final minutes of the half on a one-handed beauty where he was leaping over several Tigers' defenders. His quarterback Mac Jones is 20-of-27 passing for 385 yards and four scores.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#SEC #Alabama #LSU #CrimsonTide #DevontaSmith #MacJones #NickSaban #Coach0 #Edorgeron #SECFootball #ColegeFootball"

This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic. The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades. These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.But what is really going on here?Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?I don’t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?what does this mean for the future of international trade?And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?Enjoyed the video?
