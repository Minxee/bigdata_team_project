Producido por el promotor de conciertos puertorriqueño Rafael Pina, el espectáculo brindó una experiencia única a todos sus fanáticos en Puerto Rico utilizando la más alta tecnología y llevándolos a través de un viaje musical interpretando los mayores éxitos de sus casi 30 años de carrera. Yankee también contó con la participación de invitados especiales durante cada uno de los espectáculos, incluyendo a artistas tales como Luis Fonsi, Wisin & Yandel y Nicky Jam, entre otros.Se alentará a los espectadores [o fanáticos] a donar lo que puedan a Feeding America a través de la plataforma de YouTube.

That’s when Eddie Van Halen spent the day with a guy who had followed in his footsteps playing alongside David Lee Roth—Jason Becker. Jason had been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, and was not in good shape. Van Halen came to Jason’s house to give love and support—as well as a guitar—to his friend and to film an ALS awareness promotional video. During that time, Eddie told stories, talked about his creative process, and played amazing music, instantly sounding exactly like Eddie Van Halen even when playing Jason’s guitar through a small practice amp.This never-before-seen footage shows a side of Eddie Van Halen that goes far beyond his brilliant musicianship: a sweet, caring, generous personality, devoid of the trappings of fame or rock stardom. The video also documents the incredible strength of Jason Becker, who had been deprived of his shot at fame as well as his genius guitar skills, but still found the courage and the will to battle a debilitating disease.“Eddie was such a beautiful person,” says Becker. “He was incredibly kind to me and my family. Not only was he my biggest influence, he had such a huge heart. He honestly saved my life.”This video is a must-see piece of history, not just for guitarists but for everyone. It truly shows the magic of kindness, and a depth of emotion that we can all use more of.https://jasonbecker.com/Triumphant Hearts Available Now: http://smarturl.it/JasonBecker#JasonBecker #EddieVanHalen #EVH #WolfgangVanHalen #VanHalen #ALS #TriumphantHearts #HoldOnToLove"

A 2020 recipient of the Country Music Association’s Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, Pride is an inspiration to generations of performers, a model of quiet dignity and artful fortitude.Raised in the segregated South as the son of a sharecropper, Charley Frank Pride was born on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi, fifty miles south of Memphis. He spent his childhood laboring in fields, playing baseball, and listening to the Grand Ole Opry on a Philco radio. He bought his first guitar when he was fourteen, and began developing a style of singing that would come to impress his heroes.“What came from my throat was my voice, no one else’s,” he wrote in his autobiography. “No one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another — I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.”At 16, Pride left Mississippi and played baseball in the Negro American League. He was enamored of Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1947.“To say that he was my idol would be an understatement,” Pride said. “As far as I was concerned, Jackie Robinson had rewritten the future.”Pride never realized his Major League Baseball dreams, but he rewrote country music’s future. His gifts as a singer were greater than his athletic prowess. In 1962, country stars Red Sovine and Red Foley heard Pride singing in Helena, Montana, and encouraged him to come to Nashville. A year later, Pride auditioned in Nashville for manager Jack Johnson, and Johnson was astounded.Johnson introduced Pride to renegade producer Cowboy Jack Clement. On August 16, 1965, Clement took Pride to RCA’s Nashville studio and recorded demonstration recordings that impressed RCA head man Chet Atkins, who flew to Los Angeles and received approval from the label brass to sign Pride to the label.Pride’s first single, “Snakes Crawl at Night,” was released in January of 1966. Pride’s race was shielded from country radio disc jockeys until the third single, “Just Between You and Me,” climbed into the country Top Ten. The cover of his gold-selling first album, Country Charley Pride, was the first time many fans discovered that he was Black.“I get a lot of questions asked me . . . ‘Charley, how’d you get into country music and why you don’t sound like you’re supposed to sound,’” Pride said during a 1968 concert at Panther Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. “It’s a little unique, I admit. But I’ve been singing country music since I was about five-years-old. This is why I sound like I sound.” Pride responded to discrimination with square-jawed silence, determined that talent would overcome prejudice. His work spoke volumes. He was the CMA’s Entertainer of the Year in 1971, and he scored twenty-nine #1 country hits, including enduring classics “Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone,” “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’,” “All I Have to Offer You Is Me,” and “Mountain of Love.” He was named the CMA’s top male vocalist in 1971 and 1972, and was one of RCA’s top-selling artists for decades.Pride was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, seven years before his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. At the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum’s donation ceremony for Jack Clement’s guitar in 2019 Pride recalled his early recordings. He said that Clement told him, “Charley these songs we’re recording right now, fifty years from now they’re gonna be spinnin’ ‘em.”It has been more than fifty years, and those songs are still spinning."

We didn't have a deep relationship.... He shared that freestyle on the spot wasn't his thing but he mentioned that his pen game was mean! He sent me 6 bars... we listened.. tweaked it and he finished the song in about 4 weeks. He let me know he was coming to New York for his album so i asked to shoot the vid! His publicist said he has/likes Hellcat Redeye's! When i met him he made it known he was gonna hit the drivers seat! 2 days later he passed. I have an interview i recorded that day but I'm not going to release it... no need. After Von passed we couldn’t find the session/vocals/track.

Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life’s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch’s long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon’s McMafia)—and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.Nobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch’s father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch’s brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  The film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a. (Hell or High Water, Wind River), for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu’s PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, Annie Marter and Tobey Maguire."

Claire has made tarts where the apples overcaramelized and stuck to the skillet, stayed blond and released tons of moisture, or shrunk dramatically. Differences in the freshness of apples was always the problem. In this video Claire will show you a method to help coax out some moisture to help correct those problems and leave you with a delicious tarte tatin that is every bit as good as the traditional version.

We pulled from one of the most iconic of this group to create what we now call the Aint Care Bear.  Jason from Rotiform had it machined on the spot, we wrapped it in Toyo Proxes rubber, and then gave it a proper Hoonigan style break-in.

In the 13’ Ronaldo opened the scoring when he found the back of the net from the penalty spot. Then just 7 minutes later, Weston McKennie, the US Men’s National Team player, doubled the Juventus lead when acrobatically parked one in the net. Ronaldo was not finished with his day of scoring as he powered another home from the penalty spot yet again in the 52’.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Abby O'Neill | December 8, 2020Powerful sister duo Chloe x Halle went all out on this one. Flanked by personal memorabilia supplied by their mother, the Bailey sisters did their best to make this studio performance really feel like a home concert.As they volley off each other, swapping lead and harmonies, it's amazing to watch how years of practice and innate genetic chemistry have them synced tighter than a SMPTE timecode. Baby Girl, the second song here, starts with notes reminiscent of Crystal Waters' Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless), and is preceded with Chloe sharing I know this year 2020 has been absolutely bonkers for all of us. For those moments where you kinda feel less than and you're not good enough ... that's why we wrote this song. ... Whatever happens, we'll be OK. And this is our world.
