This is the Oat & Pecan Brittle Cookies recipe from Dessert Person. This chewy, butterscotchy oat cookie might not be the kind you can casually whip up on a whim. But, if you go through the steps to make it, like making the pecan brittle, grinding the oats, and browning the butter, you will be rewarded with hands-down the most delicious oat cookie you've ever tried. Somewhere between a lacy cookie and a chewy one, it's giant, buttery, and sweet-salty. Make them along with Claire and remember to keep some of the dough frozen so you're never more than 20 minutes away from a perfect warm cookie.

By 6 p.m., all parts of the tri-state were seeing snow stick to roads and surfaces. Towns in New Jersey already reported a few inches of snow by 6 p.m. — before the worst had even arrived. The storm will intensify over the course of the evening, with the heaviest snow and strong gusts expected to start before 7 p.m.Winter storm warnings are now in effect for most of the region, including all five boroughs of New York City, through Thursday afternoon.

With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. The singers may attempt to throw off the crowd, but keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show.

In War On Drugs, we examine the social implications of prohibition worldwide. Any attempt to shut down the trade in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine or weed invariably sets off a chain of events that just makes things worse, leaving a trail of death, illness, violence, slavery, addiction, crime and inequality across the globe. Everyone loses – except, in a weird kind of way, the drugs themselves.

Eddie Van Halen had battled all kinds of cancer for years, and it was originally reported that the guitar god succumbed to lung cancer. Van Halen was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2000, following years of cigarettes and booze ... and guitar picks? He would later say he believed the cancer was caused by the metal in the pick he often held in his mouth. Either way, he had part of his tongue removed in 2002, and he said it was the part that his copper and brass guitar picks always touched.He was regularly treated for the cancer through the years, but it eventually began to spread even further through his body, including to his lungs. When he died, it was announced that he had lost his battle with cancer. However, according to his death certificate obtained by TMZ, while Eddie definitely did suffer from several debilitating medical conditions — including lung and skin cancers, pneumonia, and a disorder affecting the bone marrow called myelodysplastic syndrome — the official cause of death was a stroke.TMZ also reported Eddie's wishes about what should be done with his remains. His body was cremated 22 days after his death, and the ashes were received by his son, Wolfgang. The Eruption soloist's final wishes stated that his ashes be scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Malibu. Eddie and Wolfgang were very close both on and off stage, so you can bet that Wolfgang will honor his father's final wishes. Wolfgang tweeted the day his father died,He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift. [...] I love you so much, Pop.Released on November 16, the first single on Wolfgang's pending first solo album was a tribute to his late father. According to Guitar World, Wolfgang dedicated the song Distance to Eddie, saying it was one of his father's favorites on the album. Wolfgang said, 'Distance' is a song that was initially written for the debut album, but was going to be held for a later time. [...] As my pop continued to struggle with various health issues, I was imagining what my life would be like without him and how terribly I'd miss him. While this song is incredibly personal, I think anyone can relate to the idea of having a profound loss in their own life. He said he hadn't planned on the song being the first solo tune of his that the public would hear, but he decided to release it in honor of his father's legacy. Saying, This is for him.Eddie said before he passed that the album sounded like, AC/DC meets Van Halen meets aggressive pop. The riffs are catchy. It's a little of everything and sounds like a freight train coming at you. I've never heard anything quite like it. It's so powerful that I'm jealous. Considering the source of the praise, that's quite the compliment. Now the world waits and listens for what else comes from the next generation of the Van Halen legacy.#EddieVanHalen #VanHalenRead Full Article: https://www.grunge.com/295473/eddie-van-halens-cause-of-death-officially-confirmed/"

The winners for global Artist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, and Breakthrough Artist of the Year were hand-selected by Apple Music’s global editorial team of world-class experts and tastemakers, and the awards for Top Song of the Year and Top Album of the Year are based on streaming data that is reflective of what Apple Music subscribers have been listening to this year.Subscribe to Apple Music: https://apple.co/AppleMusicYTFollow Apple Music:Instagram: https://instagram.com/applemusicFacebook: https://facebook.com/applemusicTwitter: https://twitter.com/applemusicWatch more Apple Music: What’s New: https://apple.co/2VFatTUApple Music Up Next: https://apple.co/2MLktXEInterviews: https://apple.co/32WnrPVWhat’s Trending: https://apple.co/2Meq89tApple Music lets you listen to millions of songs, online or off, totally ad-free.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.And the Winner of the Voice Is... - The Voice Live Finale Part 2 2020https://youtu.be/G906Fzw4k7MThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice"

Este especial se lanza en tres partes, la primera estará disponible este viernes, 4 de diciembre, mientras que la segunda y tercera parte estarán disponibles el 12 y 19 de diciembre, respectivamente. “Este año ha sido difícil para todos nosotros y qué mejor forma de comenzar la temporada navideña, sino es recordando y celebrando el aniversario de uno de mis mayores logros como artista y espero que los llene a todos de mucha alegría”, expresó Daddy Yankee. En diciembre 2019, “Con Calma Pal’ Choli” se convirtió en la única serie de conciertos en romper récords por ser la más taquillera jamás realizada en Puerto Rico, con más de 170,000 boletos vendidos en un mes. Producido por el promotor de conciertos puertorriqueño Rafael Pina, el espectáculo brindó una experiencia única a todos sus fanáticos en Puerto Rico utilizando la más alta tecnología y llevándolos a través de un viaje musical interpretando los mayores éxitos de sus casi 30 años de carrera. Yankee también contó con la participación de invitados especiales durante cada uno de los espectáculos, incluyendo a artistas tales como Luis Fonsi, Wisin & Yandel y Nicky Jam, entre otros.Se alentará a los espectadores [o fanáticos] a donar lo que puedan a Feeding America a través de la plataforma de YouTube.

At least one event in Washington featured President Donald Trump's recently pardoned former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.Rally organizers Stop The Steal, linked to pro-Trump operative Roger Stone, and church groups urged supporters to participate in Jericho Marches and prayer rallies.The protests were planned in Washington and in the capitals of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, where Trump's campaign has questioned vote counts.Trump was not expected to attend any of the protest events in D.C.MORE: https://globalnews.ca/news/7518599/trump-helicopter-washington-rally/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#Trump #GlobalNews #USElection"
