Scene #1 ‘Color of Youth’ 우리들의 청춘과 아름다운 순간의 찰나Scene #2 ‘Becoming One’ 서로가 서로를 통해 비로소 갖게 되는 우리라는 의미Scene #3 ‘Stay Bold’ 함께일 때 가장 화려하게 빛나는 우리“Shoot! Take a Panorama”타이틀곡 ‘Panorama’는 찬란한 순간을 영원히 기억하겠다는 이야기를 담은 가사로, 풍경이 그려지는 아름다운 편곡과 감성적이면서 고급스러운 멜로디 라인이 인상적인 팝 하우스 장르의 곡이다. 세 가지 신(Scene)의 흐름에서 귀결되는 ‘우리’의 의미와 상통한다.That's the Sequence디스코(Disco)와 신스팝(Synth-Pop) 기반의 댄스곡으로, 곡의 파트마다 조금씩 변하는 악기 구성이 독특한 곡이다. 연속적인 사건, 순서를 뜻하는 사전적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence)와 신(Scene)들이 모여 하나의 이야기를 나타내는 영화적 의미의 시퀀스(Sequence). 이 두 가지 의미를 모두 가사에 녹여냈다.이 밖에 영화를 연상케 하는 제목의 수록곡 '미장센(Mise-en-Scène)', 아이즈원 특유의 밝은 에너지를 담은 'Island', 강렬한 드럼사운드의 'O Sole Mio', 위즈원과의 함께하는 시간이 빠르게 지나 아쉬워 조금 더 느리게 즐기고 싶은 마음을 담은 멤버 김채원 자작곡 '느린 여행'이 트랙리스트를 풍부하게 만들었다.이처럼 [One-reeler / Act IV]는 각각의 영화적 장치 같은 수록곡들이 앨범의 구성을 풍성하게 뒷받침하여 아이즈원만의 색깔로 현재 진행 중인 성장 스토리를 보여주고 있다."

No soporto extrañartey olvidarte no consigo. (x2)(Siempre que me doy un trago)Y empiezo a recordarte sin ropa,chocando las copas y yo acariciándote. (ohh)Tu mirada, tu pelo y tu boca,te volvías loca y yo seduciéndote.(Bebé déjate llevar por el lobo)Tantos recuerdos que me siento preso de verdad.Mi mente es una vellonera y tengo la canción pegá.Sin darle al GYM ‘toy duro pero tú eres mi debilidad.Sin ti vivo en una burbuja de ansiedad.Porque es un castigoimaginar que alguien duerme contigo y que en las noches sea tu abrigo.Como DY baby sígueme y te sigo.Vente conmigo.Es que el location de tus labios no lo necesito,sé dónde es, si siempre ha sido mi spot favorito.Ahora que no te tengo cómo te explicoque tú eras la jugadora estrella de mi equipo. (I’m done)(Miky Woodz)El olor de tu pelo en la cama no lo olvido.Hay días que me quiero morir,hay otros positivos.Todos me preguntan: Doble ¿por qué tan pensativo?Ellos no saben que el amor de mi vida se ha ido.Y no quiere volver,no quiere responder.Yo estoy seguro que tú no me dejaste de querer.Mi boca extraña tu boca,mi cuerpo extraña tu piel;como te volvías loca cuando te daba placer.Y es que no me acostumbroa no estar contigo. No soporto extrañartey olvidarte no consigo. (x2)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Eres mi debilidad. (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)Tú eres mía nada más.

Today I thought it would be fun to try to decorate a gingerbread house, in order to get a little festive and do some creative christmas themed projects. If you've never tried making a DIY gingerbread house before, don't let this video scare you, you definitely should! It's a really fun activity to do with friends and family where you can get creative. Also, no matte how ugly it turns out, it always tastes good 😂 . There are always tons of make your own gingerbread house kits available around this time of year. But make sure you get plenty of extra frosting and candy for decorating!! 🤣 Anyway, sorry that this project didn't turn out exactly how I was hoping. I hope you enjoy it anyway, and mayyyyybe you'll get some tips on how to decorate a gingerbread house and how NOT to decorate a gingerbread house 🤣  I am hoping to do at least one more christmas themed art project this season, so make sure you stick around for that!___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 finally shows the one and only, Boba Fett in the spotlight. We see Boba return and eventually help Din Djarin and Grogu against Moff Gideon's Storm Troopers and Dark Troopers (phase 2 I think), who end up taking Grogu.Fennec Shand reminds me a lot of Zam Wessel from Attack of the Clones, who was pursued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, until Jango showed up.We also learn a lot about Jango Fett, Boba Fett's Father. We learn that Jango Fett was a Mandalorian! This is awesome! Since it was skewed in canon, it's nice to know we finally have an answer. They seem to be following his story from Open Seasons comic book series which shows the story of Jango as a boy. Long story short, Jango was the son of a farmer on Concord Dawn. A man named Jaster Mereel who was leader of the True Mandalorians, was on the run from a traitor named Tor Vizsla from Death Watch. Jango’s dad hid Jaster Mereel in his farm, and told Jango that he was feeding some homeless men. When Tor Vizsla came looking near Jango’s Dad’s farm, he found Jango’s Dad and beat him up infant of Jango, until Jango’s mom created a distraction and Jango ran for his life, leaving his parents who were immediately murdered, Fett ran into Jaster Mereel who eventually took the boy under his wing and recruited him in the Mandalorian Civil War against Death Watch, as one of the True Mandalorians. Jaster died eventually and Jango avenged him, becoming the leader of the True Mandalorians. Now the people who found Din, were death watch, so the two clans have always been waging wars against one another and have varying beliefs. Explaining this to Din, Din accepts that the armour belongs to Boba. So this armour, is just repainted from his dad’s, from Jango’s. The deal is done, says Din, where Boba assures him that it is not, as he promised the safety of the child in return for his armour. Now Boba joins the crew until the child is safe. Flying in the Slave 1, they arrive on Nevarro 7, where Cara Dune is now a New Republic Marshal, where he asks her to locate Mayfeld, who you might remember from season 1. Mando is going to spring him out of jail to locate Moff Gideon’s cruiser.We jump to Moff Gideon’s light cruiser, he walks to the cell containing the child.As Moff Gideon enters, we see Grogu using the force on stormtroopers. Even going as far as using force choke, to which many might think is a dark side move, but, I should mention, Luke Skywalker used it as well in Return of the Jedi, and he was far from the dark side.As Grogu knocks them out, Gideon steps up to him and ignites his dark saber, asking Grogu if he remembers one of these, meaning if he remembers using a lightsaber or having seen many lightsabers during his time as a Jedi at the Jedi Temple before Order 66. Grogu is tired, I think because he had to cut himself off from the force for so long that he isn’t used to using it as much as when he was at the Jedi temple learning from the many masters. Using the force can also tire one out, like it does to Luke in the empire strikes back when failing to lift the x-wing out of Yoda’s swamp. They blast Grogu with a stun blast, and cuff him. Gideon tells his officer to contact Dr. Pershing, the cloning doctor responsible for the experiments on the child, to tell him that they have their donor. The plan now is for Gideon to kill Grogu to harvest all of his blood which has force powers, or in Star Wars lingo, a high Midichlorian count. End of the episode.It was amazing. Simply amazing. My favourite episode of the entire show so far, which is saying a lot. Boba is back and badder than ever, as Terry Silver would say. I think the next episode will revolve around rescuing Mayfeld from Jail, and then tracking the light cruiser or going to Dr. Pershing who will have the child momentarily. I think the season finale will end in a Big Bang all out battle like end game. With everyone we’ve seen from this season fighting together against Moff Gideon and his dark troopers, as he himself gets in a phase 3 dark trooper mega suit to destroy Din. Hopefully Ahsoka Tano returns with Bo Katan, and we get to see another Jedi, Luke or Ezra is my guess.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join"

Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of levitating and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.While we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our home series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape.

This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic. The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades. These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.But what is really going on here?Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?I don’t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?what does this mean for the future of international trade?And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?Enjoyed the video?

And there are already stars starting to get very close.OUR CHANNELS▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀German Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDESpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeESHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀This is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!Get Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  Join the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  DISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Reddit:            https://kgs.link/redditInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagramTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitterFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebookDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discordNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletterOUR VOICE▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀The Kurzgesagt voice is from Steve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voiceOUR MUSIC ♬♪▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:Spotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotifySoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloudBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcampYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtubeFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebookThe Soundtrack of this video:Soundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3lsKxq3Bandcamp:     https://bit.ly/3opxF63 🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Many Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:Vincent Mascio, Gabriel Sucia, Артем Ярошенко, Thomas Hradek, Nebual, Rodrigo Espinosa, Jacobo Loewen, Kirsten Mann, Matias Altalef, Renato Vassão, triger traiger, Richard Decal, SmokinBuddha, R D, William Lucca, John Teeslink, Yrjosmiel, Tomasz Stachowiak, WE1RD, ScorchedShadow, Zach Knibbs, jrinehimer, Michael, Conner Boltz, Sidong Fu, Jake Kish, Caeruleus, Gleb Radchenko, Kieren Quinn, Augustine, Che Tao, Biken Gurung, Adelina Bakieva, Alex Ellis, Trevor Shackelford, Graham Gersdorff, Aditya Taday, Chaitali Sura, Rhys Clark, Trymian Cassidy, Anton Vietrov, Samuel Blanchard, libor riska, Julia VS, Stoney Bair, Nika Chkhartishvili, Erwin Ritua, Nicholas Roth, Mark Pickenheim, Haaxor1689, Niklas, Sean K Reynolds, Mark Gubatan, Caleb Biasco, MoeMoep, Edmund Sang Fontaine, Silquetoast, Randy Cully, Joseph Schadler, Matt Cameron, x yxy, Elie & Mary-Anne, Alaina Kramer, Memes, Dragon's Demize, Caleb Whitaker, KushrenadaT, Andrei, Daniel Suzuki, Jett Thomas, Laszlo Steinhoff, Alexander Brown, Braden Culbert, Sarah, Corey Austen, Gosia Rychlik, Евген Останинов, Neo Martin, Anonimas, Nicolas Sepulveda, Nicole de Vries, Maryam Sheybanifard, John Forbes, ertojo, Zaten the Changeling, Dmytro Haranzha, Matt Clarkson, G Crockett, Brennen Schott, Mirek Novak, Pedro Lozano, Oskar Syahbana, Robin, Porky Hontas, Sebastien J, Eileen Kirschner, Peyton Groshart, Martin, Jan Ryklikas, Dr. Daniel Lehmann, Le plus Luc de tous les Luc, yeapea [Andi], Ansgar Rust, Jan Karsten, Hichem Moussa VoulezVouloz, Morbeyn, Sjoerd Smit, Julian Hiorns, The Wanton Dogfish, Alice Whiteway, Jordan Lake, Whitney Warren, Moses Holmström, Morgan"
