I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do a rematch!Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin#MinecraftManhunt"

Dynamo Kyiv had to come out victorious in this one to stay in the hunt for qualification. Early in the second half, Barcelona came out firing. Sergiño Dest, who is the first American to ever play for Barcelona, gave his side the 1-0 lead with a goal in the 52’ marking his first goal since December 2019 back when he was playing for Ajax. Then just a few minutes later, Barcelona doubled its lead with a Martin Braithwaite goal in the 57’. Barcelona kept their foot on the gas as they laid on another goal in the 70’ when Braithwaite put away his penalty shot to notch his second goal of the evening. Dest almost notched his second goal of the match in the 88’ put sailed it just a bit high. In the 90'+2 Antoine Griezmann added one more goal for insurance to secure the 4-0 win for the Spanish side. Barcelona would hold on to win 3-0 over Dynamo Kyiv and with the loss, Dynamo Kyiv was eliminated from contention.

In the 70’ the ball came to Ronaldo’s feet as he timed his run perfectly, he got behind the very last line and just had the keeper to beat and the Ferencvaros keeper barely got his hand on the ball as Ronaldo dribbled past and denied the opportunity. Juventus had one final opportunity in stoppage time to win the game. Álvaro Morata put it away in the 90’+2 to give Juventus the 2-1 late. The late goal was cause for celebration for Juventus, but Ferencvaros was heartbreaking as they stood toe to toe with the strong Juventus side.

So here’s one that at first glance will make you roll your eyes, but by the end of this video, I think you’ll be able to see a lot of the plausibility of things.The more I write this theory, the more it makes sense, but first we need to understand a lot of lore and backstory, so sit tight, and enjoy this one with me.In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, Mace Windu fell out of the window, and we haven’t seen the Jedi Master since. We saw a figment of his return in one of the Vader comics by Marvel which I have full coverage on with voice acting, if you can call it that, now this Mace isn’t really Mace, it’s some weird fragmented animated version of him....can we say he’s truly dead?In this theory video, I’m going to say he didn’t die that day. The theory I have behind this, is that we heard his voice speak to Rey in the rise of Skywalker. You’re probably thinking, well…that definitely means he’s dead, right?Sure, maybe, but, how did he speak to Rey? If it wasn’t for Qui-Gon Jinn, no one would be a force ghost. Qui-Gon Jinn met with the shaman of the whills, now these were ancient powerful beings, almost like priests of some sorts. During Qui-Gon’s life, they taught him how to transfer his essence beyond death. However, due to his untimely demise, he wasn’t able to complete his training, therefore only able to manifest his voice as a ghost, and not his body, until much later near a new hope which can be read in the book from a certain point of view. In Revenge of the Sith, Qui-Gon’s force ghost speaks to Yoda, it was cut from the film, but it was dialogued in the deleted scenes and written in the original script. That moment on Polis Massa where Yoda is meditating during Padme’s labor, to which Bail Organa, the future adopted father of Leia, interrupts Yoda’s communication with Qui-Gon. Once Padme dies and obi-wan and Yoda speak, we learn that Qui-Gon is now Yoda’s master, who has taught him how to commune with him in the force. To Obi-Wan’s surprise, Qui-Gon is still very much around in the force.So, where did he go? The Star Wars galaxy is huge, and it’s possible that he fled somewhere, or went in hiding, just like Yoda, Obi-Wan and the rest of the survivors of Order 66. What if he went somewhere to some unknown planet in the unknown regions somewhere to hide and train more Jedi? What if he became a Mandalorian? Nothing would suit his scarred and recognizable face better than hiding under a helmet. This leads me to my next theory, what if Mace Windu is in The Mandalorian? What if he shows up in season2 or 3 or more? Mace Windu was unbelievably powerful, so powerful that he went toe to toe with the Emperor.Now, if Mace is alive, seeing him as a Mandalorian would not just be cool, it would fit a lot of the story for the Jedi that could help reunite the child with his species. There is no person in the galaxy that knows Yoda better than Mace Windu. He sat with him as second in command, and in some cases, first in command. Mace in a lot of ways, was the chosen one. He used the light and the dark, he was the master of his emotions, and he had surpassed all of his teachers as a young boy, growing to become the most powerful Jedi just before Anakin could see his full potential until he lost to OBiWan.Let’s say Mando takes The Child to Ahsoka, and she eventually tells him of someone who can really show him the way to reuniting the Child with its species, pointing him to another Easter egg hunt throughout the galaxy, to Mace Windu.Mace could be laying low, perhaps growing his crops and training those who exhibited force powers at an early age. Perfecting his abilities and learning more about all aspects of the force, and eventually along the way, learning a ton from Yoda who communed with him, and Obi-Wan after their deaths. Perhaps even, coming across Luke Skywalker and learning of the fate of Anakin and the Emperor. Teaching Luke so much about his father’s youth.This could be Mace’s return, this could be how Mace fits into the Mandalorian. So you’re probably saying, well ok, but what about his death…well…What if while the Mando is finding the path to Mace Windu, he is followed by someone notorious flying the Slave 1 ship and once he does leave Mace, with the information on where to reunite The Child with his parents, Boba comes to him. How poetic would it be if Mace Windu’s death came full circle, and what I mean is, Boba Fett finds him, and kills him, transcending him into the force…avenging his father, Jango.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/joinedited @Star Wars Elseworlds thumbnail @Benny Productions music @Samuel Kim Music"
